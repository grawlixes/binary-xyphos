# binary-xyphos
An improved version of "Xyphos," my primitive text file compression algorithm. This algorithm uses "Huffman Coding," an old method of representing binary values, to compress and decompress text files.

# why is it better?
There are several reasons.

	- Time complexity: 

	- Lossless: my old program doesn't conserve the case of letters. This
	  program saves everything.

These improvements exist because I am compressing files at a lower level. In
Xyphos, I tried compressing without considering any information below text
level; in Binary Xyphos, I'm compressing at the binary level. This showcases
both my program's efficiency and my top-tier project naming skills.
